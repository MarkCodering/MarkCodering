## Developer Community Builder and Lead 
I became a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador in early 2021. My mission as an MLSA at Taiwan and my university is to spread the idea of "empowering everyone and organisation to achieve more with Microsoft technologies and beyond". To accomplish that vision, I collaborated with another talented Microsoft Ambassador from National Taiwan University. Together, I envision a future where people can be benefited from the technologies.

## Avionics Engineer, Space Technology Lab, Tamkang University
I joined the space technology lab in late August 2021. Our mission and vision as a lab and student team in Tamkang University, Taiwan is to push the frontier of student rocket development in Taiwan while devoting our full measure of passion and knowledge to that project. I am an avionics engineer and software developer within the avionics team. My main responsibility is to develop software solutions for the launch system while integrating various hardware with different protocols.
