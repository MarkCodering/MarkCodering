### Research & Systems
I work on building **generalizable machine intelligence**—systems that reason, act, and improve through interaction.

My work spans:
- Agentic reasoning and tool-use in large language models  
- Evaluation, alignment, and feedback-driven learning  
- Quantum-inspired approaches to learning and representation  
- Translating research ideas into deployed systems

---

### Current Work
- **Mindify AI** — infrastructure and monetization for AI agents  
- Agent reasoning, evaluation, and system-level alignment  
- Research writing and long-horizon system design

---

### Principles
> Build systems, not demos.  
> Measure what matters.  
> Agency precedes scale.

*Interested in how intelligence emerges—and how to build it responsibly.*
