## Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador
I became a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador at early 2021. My mission as a MLSA at Taiwan and my university is to spread the idea of "empowering everyone and organisation to achieve more with Microsoft technologies and beyond". To accomplish that vision, I collaborated with an another talented Microsoft Ambassador from National Taiwan Universiy. Together, I envision a future where people can be benefited from the technologies.
